# socially-awkward

## Description

Whether at a work function or social gathering, some people have a hard time initiating conversation with a stranger. It can be difficult to come up with something to break the ice. 

This project was created with that in mind and an effort to alleviate the anxiety or awkwardness that comes with trying to start a conversation with a complete stranger.  

By providing fact tidbits or jokes an individual can tell, this site provides the user with ready made conversation starters.

This project allowed us to learn more about API's and how to call them. In fact, we used 4 different API's for this project. We also learned how to implement the CSS framework Bulma to create a polished user interface. Being that this project involved 2 contributors we also learned some of the ins and outs of GitHub collaboration and project management. We also learned how to create a gif to add to our README.md file.
